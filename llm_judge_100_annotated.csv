the only reason i remember this movie is because it was ( and still is ) the biggest waste of time and money ever spent . i was 17 and my friend was 18. we were the age when action movies were our thing to enjoy most ( ok 2nd most ) . we walked out feeling so insulted , we wanted our money back , but the time could never be regained . the editing is what killed this movie . as the truck gets attacked by more and more vehicles with rocket launchers attached the movie completely insults the intelligence of the audience by having these rogue bad guys in 4x4 vw bugs shooting rockets at the truck . please , rockets at a truck known to be carrying plutonium ? what 's worse is the these vw 's manage to get 15-18 shots off of a 4 rocket launcher . you would see on vw with 4 rockets fire 2 of them , cut around the truck with the last one attached , come back a second later with two rockets attached , fire another , then go in front of the truck and now it 's back to a full set of 4 rockets . we toughed it out hoping for a big finish that never happened . it looks like they just ran out of money and stopped . just ridiculous .

man with the gun is pretty much forgotten now , but caused a minor storm of media interest back in 1955 when robert mitchum turned down both jett rink in giant ( which had actually been written for him and which was subsequently substantially reworked ) and charles laughton 's intended version of the naked and the dead to make it instead . despite some obvious production problems and some harsh lighting that occasionally renders both mitch and jan sterling in unflattering tones , it 's a terrific dark western that more than stands comparison with his earlier blood on the moon as his 'town tamer ' sets to work on a town that never had the chance to grow up before getting run down by the local badmen before turning out to  possibly  be almost as bad as the men he dispatches . certainly his way of dealing with news of a death in the family  burning a saloon to the ground and goading its manager into trying to kill him  does n't inspire much confidence in his stability . as well as a good script and a surprisingly good supporting turn from the usually irritating but here well cast henry hull , it also boasts a strikingly good early alex north score , which even includes an early workout for one of his tormented emotional cues that would later turn up in spartacus .

dull acting , weak script ... worst spanish movie in years ... i was attracted by the ( naked ) beauty of paz vega , but as an actress she 's useless , you almost ca n't understand what she 's saying ... about the story there 's not much coherent to say ... we heard of it before , but as this is a `` modern carmen '' we find a few changes : -the french soldier is now a basque soldier . -merimee himself is a character in the story . -carmen is a dangerous `` bandolera '' in love with a famous `` matador '' and she can speak fluent basque ... can anyone understand this mess ?

6216,"i saw this movie during a tolkien-themed interim class during my sophomore year of college . i was seated unfortunately close to the screen and my professor chose me to serve as a whipping boy- everyone else was laughing , but they were n't within constant eyesight . let 's get it out of the way : the peter jackson 'lord of the rings ' films do owe something to the bakshi film . in jackson 's version of the fellowship of the ring , for instance , the scene in which the black riders assault the empty inn beds is almost a complete carbon copy of the scene in bakshi 's film , shot by shot . you could call this plagiarism or homage , depending on your agenda . i 'm sure the similarities do n't stop there . i 'm not going to do any research to find out what they are , because that would imply i have some mote of respect for this film . i 'm sure others have outlined the similarities- look around . this movie is a complete train wreck in every sense of the metaphor , and many , many people died in the accident . i 've decided to list what i can remember in a more or less chronological fashion- if i 've left out anything else that offended me it 's because i 'm completely overwhelmed , confronted with a wealth of failure ( and , at high points , mediocrity ) . * due to heavy use of rotoscoping , gandalf is no longer a gentle , wise wizard but a wildly flailing prophet of doom ( whose hat inexplicably changes color once or twice during the course of the film ) . * saruman the white is sometimes referred to as 'aruman ' during the film , without explanation . he wears purple and red for some mysterious reason . * sam is flat out hideous . the portrayal of his friendship with frodo is strangely childlike and unsatisfying . yes , hobbits are small like children , but they are not children . * merry and pippin are never introduced -- they simply appear during a scene change with a one-sentence explanation . the film is filled with sloppy editing like this . * frodo , sam , pippin and merry are singing merrily as they skip through along the road . one of the hobbits procures a lute at least twice as large as he is from behind his back -- which was not visible before -- and begins strumming in typical fantasy bard fashion as they all break into `` la-la-la '' s. awful . * aragorn , apparently , is a native american dressed in an extremely stereotypical fantasy tunic ( no pants ) , complete with huge , square pilgrim belt buckle . he is arguably the worst swordsman in the entire movie -- oftentimes he gets one wobbly swing in before being knocked flat on his ass . * the black riders appear more like lepers than menacing instruments of evil . they limp everywhere they go at a painfully slow pace . this is disturbing to be sure , but not frightening . * the scene before the black riders attempt to cross the ford of bruinen ( in which they stare at frodo , who is on the other side on horseback ) goes on forever , during which time the riders rear their horses in a vaguely threatening manner and ... do nothing else . the scene was probably intended to illustrate frodo 's hallucinatory decline as he succumbs to his wound . it turns out to be more plodding than anything else . * gimli the dwarf is just as tall as legolas the elf . he 's a dwarf . there is simply no excuse for that . he also looks like a bastardized david the gnome . it 's a crude but accurate description . * boromir appears to have pilfered elmer fudd 's golden viking armor from that bugs bunny opera episode . he looks ridiculous . * despite the similarity to tolkien 's illustration , the balrog is howl inducing and the least-threatening villain in the entire film . it looks like someone wearing pink bedroom slippers , and it 's barely taller than gandalf . `` purists '' may prefer this balrog , but i 'll take jackson 's version any day . * the battle scenes are awkward and embarrassing . almost none of the characters display any level of competency with their armaments . i 'm not asking for action-packed scenes like those in jackson 's film , but they are supposed to be fighting . * treebeard makes a very short appearance , and i was sorry he bothered to show up at all . watch the film , you 'll see what i mean . alright , now for the good parts of the film . * some of the voice acting is pretty good . it is n't that aragorn sounds bad , he just looks kind of like the jolly green giant . * galadriel is somewhat interesting in this portrayal ; like tom bombadil , she seems immune to the ring 's powers of temptation , and her voice actress is n't horrible either . * boromir 's death is n't as heart wrenching as in jackson 's portrayal of the same scene , but it 's still appropriately dramatic ( and more true to his death in the book , though i do n't believe jackson made a mistake shooting it the way he did ) . * as my professor pointed out ( between whispered threats ) , the orcs ( mainly at helm 's deep , if i 'm correct ) resemble the war-ravaged corpses of soldiers , a political statement that works pretty well if you realize what 's being attempted . * while this is n't really a positive point about the film , bakshi ca n't be blamed for the majority of the failures in this movie , or so i 've been told -- the project was on a tight budget , and late in its production he lost creative control to some of the higher-ups ( who i 'm sure had n't read the books ) . let me be clear : i respect bakshi for even attempting something of this magnitude . i simply have a hard time believing he was happy with the final product . overall , i can not in any way recommend this blasphemous adaptation of tolkien 's classic trilogy even for laughs , unless you 've already read the books and have your own visualizations of the characters , places and events . i 'm sure somebody , somewhere , will pick a copy of this up in confusion ; if you do , keep an open mind and glean what good you can from it .",negative,negative,"You are a strict sentiment annotator.

i saw this movie during a tolkien-themed interim class during my sophomore year of college . i was seated unfortunately close to the screen and my professor chose me to serve as a whipping boy- everyone else was laughing , but they were n't within constant eyesight . let 's get it out of the way : the peter jackson 'lord of the rings ' films do owe something to the bakshi film . in jackson 's version of the fellowship of the ring , for instance , the scene in which the black riders assault the empty inn beds is almost a complete carbon copy of the scene in bakshi 's film , shot by shot . you could call this plagiarism or homage , depending on your agenda . i 'm sure the similarities do n't stop there . i 'm not going to do any research to find out what they are , because that would imply i have some mote of respect for this film . i 'm sure others have outlined the similarities- look around . this movie is a complete train wreck in every sense of the metaphor , and many , many people died in the accident . i 've decided to list what i can remember in a more or less chronological fashion- if i 've left out anything else that offended me it 's because i 'm completely overwhelmed , confronted with a wealth of failure ( and , at high points , mediocrity ) . * due to heavy use of rotoscoping , gandalf is no longer a gentle , wise wizard but a wildly flailing prophet of doom ( whose hat inexplicably changes color once or twice during the course of the film ) . * saruman the white is sometimes referred to as 'aruman ' during the film , without explanation . he wears purple and red for some mysterious reason . * sam is flat out hideous . the portrayal of his friendship with frodo is strangely childlike and unsatisfying . yes , hobbits are small like children , but they are not children . * merry and pippin are never introduced -- they simply appear during a scene change with a one-sentence explanation . the film is filled with sloppy editing like this . * frodo , sam , pippin and merry are singing merrily as they skip through along the road . one of the hobbits procures a lute at least twice as large as he is from behind his back -- which was not visible before -- and begins strumming in typical fantasy bard fashion as they all break into `` la-la-la '' s. awful . * aragorn , apparently , is a native american dressed in an extremely stereotypical fantasy tunic ( no pants ) , complete with huge , square pilgrim belt buckle . he is arguably the worst swordsman in the entire movie -- oftentimes he gets one wobbly swing in before being knocked flat on his ass . * the black riders appear more like lepers than menacing instruments of evil . they limp everywhere they go at a painfully slow pace . this is disturbing to be sure , but not frightening . * the scene before the black riders attempt to cross the ford of bruinen ( in which they stare at frodo , who is on the other side on horseback ) goes on forever , during which time the riders rear their horses in a vaguely threatening manner and ... do nothing else . the scene was probably intended to illustrate frodo 's hallucinatory decline as he succumbs to his wound . it turns out to be more plodding than anything else . * gimli the dwarf is just as tall as legolas the elf . he 's a dwarf . there is simply no excuse for that . he also looks like a bastardized david the gnome . it 's a crude but accurate description . * boromir appears to have pilfered elmer fudd 's golden viking armor from that bugs bunny opera episode . he looks ridiculous . * despite the similarity to tolkien 's illustration , the balrog is howl inducing and the least-threatening villain in the entire film . it looks like someone wearing pink bedroom slippers , and it 's barely taller than gandalf . `` purists '' may prefer this balrog , but i 'll take jackson 's version any day . * the battle scenes are awkward and embarrassing . almost none of the characters display any level of competency with their armaments . i 'm not asking for action-packed scenes like those in jackson 's film , but they are supposed to be fighting . * treebeard makes a very short appearance , and i was sorry he bothered to show up at all . watch the film , you 'll see what i mean . alright , now for the good parts of the film . * some of the voice acting is pretty good . it is n't that aragorn sounds bad , he just looks kind of like the jolly green giant . * galadriel is somewhat interesting in this portrayal ; like tom bombadil , she seems immune to the ring 's powers of temptation , and her voice actress is n't horrible either . * boromir 's death is n't as heart wrenching as in jackson 's portrayal of the same scene , but it 's still appropriately dramatic ( and more true to his death in the book , though i do n't believe jackson made a mistake shooting it the way he did ) . * as my professor pointed out ( between whispered threats ) , the orcs ( mainly at helm 's deep , if i 'm correct ) resemble the war-ravaged corpses of soldiers , a political statement that works pretty well if you realize what 's being attempted . * while this is n't really a positive point about the film , bakshi ca n't be blamed for the majority of the failures in this movie , or so i 've been told -- the project was on a tight budget , and late in its production he lost creative control to some of the higher-ups ( who i 'm sure had n't read the books ) . let me be clear : i respect bakshi for even attempting something of this magnitude . i simply have a hard time believing he was happy with the final product . overall , i can not in any way recommend this blasphemous adaptation of tolkien 's classic trilogy even for laughs , unless you 've already read the books and have your own visualizations of the characters , places and events . i 'm sure somebody , somewhere , will pick a copy of this up in confusion ; if you do , keep an open mind and glean what good you can from it .

4040,"the 1973 musical version of lost horizon is the most wonderful endearing and campy musical films of all time . the 1973 musical remake of the james hilton novel about mythical shangri-la ! is a real special gem . music by burt bacharach and lyrics by hal david . a strange mixture of straight drama , adventure and musical sequences . it has the distinction of being the only anti war musical fantasy ever filmed . this film was a critical and financial disappointment in the united states , but made a lot of money overseas . only in america did it fail . highly different and unique in it 's approach as a film musical , it deserves far better credit than it 's given . as a story , lost horizon is an incredible adventure and both the 1937 frank capra film and this 1973 musical are faithful adaptations of the james hilton novel . what i like about the 1973 version is the freedom in which the musical numbers are presented . the film has a prestigious cast and a gifted director and cinematographer . this is a burt bacharach shangri-la and it 's a wonderful place . songs like the world is a circle , share the joy and living together , growing together evoke a happiness that hilton wrote about in his novel . why should n't shangri-la be a slightly goofy place ? the two love songs , i might frighten her away and the deleted i come to you are the sensitive spots in the picture . there 's a peacefulness and soft spoken quality in both these songs that is very much keeping with the philosophy of the story . moreover , the things i will not miss is a good duet with a strong melody . it 's a nice exchange of different types of perspective and who can fault with olivia hussey and sally kellerman stomping , singing and dancing on tables ? they 're a wonderful team and the number is well staged . i always found it interesting in this story how the high lama kidnaps someone from the outside world to take his place in shangri-la . the character of the high lama is a gentle soul but somewhat radical in his view of mankind as a whole . he has no hope for the world outside of shangri-la . if this film were to be remade today , it would be interesting to see more emphasis put on the leading character , richard onway 's conflict with what he left behind in the outside world as opposed to what he 's found in shangri-la . of course , for the film to be believable , the character of richard conway must be presented as suffering amnesia at the end , like he was in the book . neither film versions of lost horizon were faithful to the novel in that regard . did conway find shangri-la or was it imagined ?

Review:
the 1973 musical version of lost horizon is the most wonderful endearing and campy musical films of all time . the 1973 musical remake of the james hilton novel about mythical shangri-la ! is a real special gem . music by burt bacharach and lyrics by hal david . a strange mixture of straight drama , adventure and musical sequences . it has the distinction of being the only anti war musical fantasy ever filmed . this film was a critical and financial disappointment in the united states , but made a lot of money overseas . only in america did it fail . highly different and unique in it 's approach as a film musical , it deserves far better credit than it 's given . as a story , lost horizon is an incredible adventure and both the 1937 frank capra film and this 1973 musical are faithful adaptations of the james hilton novel . what i like about the 1973 version is the freedom in which the musical numbers are presented . the film has a prestigious cast and a gifted director and cinematographer . this is a burt bacharach shangri-la and it 's a wonderful place . songs like the world is a circle , share the joy and living together , growing together evoke a happiness that hilton wrote about in his novel . why should n't shangri-la be a slightly goofy place ? the two love songs , i might frighten her away and the deleted i come to you are the sensitive spots in the picture . there 's a peacefulness and soft spoken quality in both these songs that is very much keeping with the philosophy of the story . moreover , the things i will not miss is a good duet with a strong melody . it 's a nice exchange of different types of perspective and who can fault with olivia hussey and sally kellerman stomping , singing and dancing on tables ? they 're a wonderful team and the number is well staged . i always found it interesting in this story how the high lama kidnaps someone from the outside world to take his place in shangri-la . the character of the high lama is a gentle soul but somewhat radical in his view of mankind as a whole . he has no hope for the world outside of shangri-la . if this film were to be remade today , it would be interesting to see more emphasis put on the leading character , richard onway 's conflict with what he left behind in the outside world as opposed to what he 's found in shangri-la . of course , for the film to be believable , the character of richard conway must be presented as suffering amnesia at the end , like he was in the book . neither film versions of lost horizon were faithful to the novel in that regard . did conway find shangri-la or was it imagined ? did they all die in the plane crash ? every man has his own idea of what his shangri-la would be . the conflict with conway wanting to believe in shangri-la and returning to his old life in the outside world is powerful . i like the melancholy on the faces of kellerman , kennedy and van as they watch their friends leave the mystical valley . interesting how conway does n't want to leave paradise , but is being pressured out by his brother . both versions of lost horizon work in different ways , but both are successful in probing james hiltons ideas of a hidden valley where money has no value and moderation is the rule . so in a sense it 's anti capitalism in it 's theme where as money and materialism is not the motivation . human kindness , decency , compassion , courtesy , etiquette and living harmoniously with each other is the rule . lost horizon has a much stronger story than most musicals . it attempts to answer the basic fundamental questions of life and one can hardly fault it for not succeeding . one has to remember that lost horizon in 1973 was post cabaret . it was no longer fashionable for characters to break out in song in a musical , much less to be dubbed by other singers . lost horizon was an easy target for jaded critics . the expectations for it were high , almost unreasonable . there were two targets to be hit , the producer , ross hunter and burt bacharach and the critics were out to get both of them . ross hunter had enjoyed decades of financial success as a producer and lost horizon was his follow up film to his 1970 blockbuster airport that film was universals biggest moneymaker up to that time and the success of that picture triggered a decade of disaster films . for years airport was the most watched film ever to be shown on television . it was nominated for 11 academy awards including best picture . at the time , burt bacharach and hal david were the most successful songwriters in the country . the unabashed sentimentality of lost horizon hardly had a chance in the wake of the breakdown of censorship in films like easy rider , midnight cowboy and the godfather . sex and violence was a new frontier in the late 60 's and early 70 's audiences were flocking to films with content that they were not use to seeing on the screen . lavish musicals were no longer well received no matter how well they were made . today lost horizon can be enjoyed and appreciated on several levels . it 's the ultimate escapist film with a strong story , wonderful music , an expensive budget and some quirky humor . it 's unconventional in the sense that the music is not introduced until 45 minutes into the film . it changes course mid way when the mystical valley is introduced and why not ?
